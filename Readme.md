## Tech Used


### Mobile Application
1. Swift and SwiftUI: Swift which is a great framework to build iOS applications. It's an improvement on UIKit ensuring it's user friendly and powerful to power modern apps'.

2. MVVM: For state management of prompts, MVVM architecture is used. This allows the code to be precise, with each module being more focused towards solving one problem.



### AI API
1. Node.js: Yoda AI's backend is powered by Node.js, a fast and scalable JavaScript runtime. Node.js enables seamless handling of requests and provides a foundation for building robust server-side applications.

2. Express.js: Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, is used for building the API endpoints that power Yoda AI's interactions. It simplifies routing, middleware integration, and request handling.

3. TypeScript: TypeScript is the language of choice for Yoda AI's codebase. It adds static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity.

4. AWS Lambda: Yoda AI takes advantage of AWS Lambda, a serverless computing service, to host and execute its backend functions. AWS Lambda ensures high availability and scalability without the need to manage infrastructure.

5. Serverless Framework: The Serverless Framework streamlines the deployment and management of serverless applications, including AWS Lambda functions, making development more efficient.

6. Docker: Docker containers are used for local development and testing, ensuring consistency between development and production environments.

7. Langchain, LLMs & OpenAI: I started by using OpenAI to build the AI and I will include a branch called llm which has code for the same using Langchain and LLMs.
